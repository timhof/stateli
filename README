Stateli Personal Finance


Stateli is a personal expense management application. Account statements are imported by users. It is not necessary to provide access to bank accounts or credit accounts. Rules may be created which will automatically categorize expenses based on transaction characterstics such as descriptions, dates, amounts, etc..

Stateli is a Rails 2 application which makes extensive use of JQuery libary. I am currently in the process of upgrading this to Rails 3. I also plan on adding support of more statement formats.
